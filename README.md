# Image_Processing1

Translate the given Lena image by (tx = 3.75, ty = 4.3) pixels. Use bilinear interpolation during target-tosource mapping.
Observation: -
a) Actual image is smoother than the translated image.
b) Translated image is showing little jaggedness due to bilinear interpolation.
c) We can see black line along the x-axis and Y-axis in the translated image because the image has been 
translated by 3.75 along the x-axis and 4.3 along the y- axis.
d) The translated region appears black because zero intensity has been assigned to the translated positions.
