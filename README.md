# Geometric Transforms

(1)Translate the given Lena image by (tx = 3.75, ty = 4.3) pixels. Use bilinear interpolation during target-to-source mapping.

(2)Rotate the given Pisa image about the image centre, so as to straighten the Pisa tower. Use bilinear 
interpolation during target-to-source mapping.

(3)Uniformly scale the given cells image by 0.8 and 1.3 factors separately. Use bilinear interpolation during 
target-to-source mapping.
